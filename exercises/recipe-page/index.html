            whenever we craved a break from more traditional Arab dishes she 
            makes. Drawing inspiration from her recipe, these tacos are stuffed 
            with seasoned ground beef cooked to perfection, wrapped in a crispy 
            tortilla, and oozing with melty Monterey Jack cheese. It’s the 
            easiest dinner that everyone always loves, even the pickiest of 
            eaters!
