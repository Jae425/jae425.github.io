                <h3>Greetings, Beautiful Souls!</h3>
                <p>
                    It's Day 3 of my QueenLocs journey, and I'm thrilled to 
                    share my experiences and progress with you. Transitioning 
                    to locs is not just a hairstyle change; it's a lifestyle 
                    transformation. Each day brings new discoveries, 
                    challenges, and moments of joy. Let's dive into 
                    today's adventure!

                <h3>Morning Routine: Nurturing the Roots</h3>
                <img
                    src="images/Queeen2.jpeg"
                    width="350px"

                >
                <p>
                    I started my day with a gentle scalp massage using a 
                    mixture of rose water and a few drops of tea tree oil. 
                    This not only helps in moisturizing my scalp but also 
                    keeps it refreshed and free from any itchiness. 
                    Following that, I used a light oil blend of jojoba and 
                    coconut oil to seal in the moisture.

                <h3>Midday Reflections: Getting Comfortable with the Process</h3>
                <img

                    width="350px"

                <p>
                    As I went about my day, I couldn't help but notice how 
                    much more comfortable I'm becoming with my locs. 
                    The initial stiffness is beginning to soften, and 
                    they're starting to take on their unique shape and 
                    character. I received a few compliments, which boosted 
                    my confidence and reaffirmed my decision to embark on 
                    this journey.
