                        <b>Cyberpunk 2077</b> is a 2020 action role-playing video 
                        game developed by CD Projekt Red, and published by 
                        CD Projekt, and based on Mike Pondsmith's Cyberpunk 
                        tabletop game series. The plot is set in the fictional 
                        metropolis of Night City, California, within the 
                        dystopian Cyberpunk universe. The player assumes the role of V 
                        (voiced by Gavin Drea/Cherami Leigh), a mercenary who 
                        accidentally gets imbued with a cybernetic "bio-chip" 
                        containing an engram of legendary rockstar and terrorist 
                        Johnny Silverhand (voiced by Keanu Reeves). As Johnny’s 
                        behaviour and memories begin overwriting V’s own, the two 
                        must work together to separate from each 
                        other and save V's life.

                        The game's development began following the release of 
                        The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt – Blood and Wine (2016). 
                        The game was developed by a team of around 500 people 
                        using the REDengine 4 game engine. CD Projekt launched 
                        a new division in Wrocław, Poland, and partnered with 
                        Digital Scapes, Nvidia, QLOC, and Jali Research to aid 
                        the production. Cyberpunk creator Mike Pondsmith was a 
                        consultant, and actor Keanu Reeves had a starring role. 
                        The original score was led by Marcin Przybyłowicz, 
                        and featured the contributions of several licensed 
                        artists. After years of anticipation, CD Projekt 
                        released Cyberpunk 2077 for PlayStation 4, 
                        Google Stadia, Microsoft Windows, and Xbox One on 
                        10 December 2020, followed by PlayStation 5 and 
                        Xbox Series X/S on 15 February 2022.
