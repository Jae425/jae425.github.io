                        <b>Cyberpunk 2077</b> is a 2020 action role-playing video 
                        game developed by CD Projekt Red, and published by 
                        CD Projekt, and based on Mike Pondsmith's Cyberpunk 
                        tabletop game series. The plot is set in the fictional 
                        metropolis of Night City, California, within the 
                        dystopian Cyberpunk universe. The player assumes the role of V 
                        (voiced by Gavin Drea/Cherami Leigh), a mercenary who 
                        accidentally gets imbued with a cybernetic "bio-chip" 
                        containing an engram of legendary rockstar and terrorist 
                        Johnny Silverhand (voiced by Keanu Reeves). As Johnny’s 
                        behaviour and memories begin overwriting V’s own, the two 
                        must work together to separate from each 
                        other and save V's life.

            <p>
                Cyberpunk 2077 takes place in Night City, an American 
                megacity in the Free State of North California which 
                functions as a corporatocracy unaffected by federal or state 
                legislation. The city suffers from rampant gang violence and 
                corporate warfare, exacerbated by an ineffectual and corrupt 
                municipal government and police force. Night City relies on 
                robotic technology for everyday functions such as waste 
                management, building and infrastructure maintenance, and 
                public transportation.[30][31] The city's architecture and 
                fashions are derived from the four aesthetics eras it 
                underwent— Entropism, Kitsch, Neo-Militarism, and 
                Neo-Kitsch.[32] Homelessness and poverty are widespread in 
                the city but does not preclude cybernetic modification for 
                Night City's underclasses, leading to both cosmetic addiction 
                and high levels of violence. Those whose addictions and heavy 
                modifications have rendered them mentally unstable, known as 
                cyberpsychos, are dealt with by the police tactical 
                unit MaxTac.[33][34] Privatized health corporations such as 
                Trauma Team utilize paramilitary doctors for rapid medical 
                services.[35] Due to the constant threat of physical harm, 
                open carry is permitted for all residents of Night City.[36]
